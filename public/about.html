  <h2>Why Web3?</h2>
  
  <p>
    HushBubble empowers you by embracing Web3 principles, putting data ownership back into your hands. 
    Your data is no longer stored on centralised servers controlled by corporations; instead, you get to choose where your conversations are hosted and which app to use:
    <ul>
      <li>Use a cloud server, a friend's server or host your own.</li>
      <li>Use your own company infrastructure, databases and servers.</li>
      <li>Use a third-party app or make your own using open source Web3 libraries.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Privacy and Security Redefined</h2>

  <p>
    With HushBubble, your conversations are end-to-end encrypted and stored securely wherever you choose. 
    Only you and the intended recipients have access to your messages – no third-party or centralised authority can ever intrude on your private conversations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Say goodbye to data breaches, prying eyes, and targeted advertising. 
    Your messages are your own. Your privacy is paramount.
  </p>

  <h2>Development Philosophy</h2>

    HushBubble is developed in the open, using agile techniques to incorporate user feedback and preferences. 
    We believe in the power of community-driven development, and your opinions matter.

  <h2>Powered by Bubble Protocol</h2>
  
  <p>
    HushBubble leverages Bubble Protocol for its off-chain storage needs.
    Each chat is stored in a bubble on an off-chain storage service of your choice.
    Bubbles act as secure data silos, granting fine-grained access controls through on-chain smart contracts.
    The rules of the bubble - who can access and what they can do - is defined by the smart contract.  
    The difference between a one-to-one chat, group chat or public event chat is down to the smart contract used to construct the bubble.
    This design enables custom chat rules and allows innovative new chat controls, such as permitting only NFT holders to access a chat.
