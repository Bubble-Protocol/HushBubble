  <h1>HushBubble</h1>

  <p>Welcome to HushBubble – the Web3 Decentralised Chat Experience!</p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://bubbleprotocol.com/chat">Take me to the app!</a>
  </p>

  <h2>What is HushBubble?</h2>

  <p>
    HushBubble is the beginnings of a revolutionary messaging app powered by Web3 and the blockchain.  
    It's mission is to be a secure, private, and user-centric chat platform that puts you and your company in control of your data.
  </p>
  <p>
    As we embark on this innovative venture, we invite you to be an integral part of our development process. 
    Your input, feedback, and ideas will steer the course of HushBubble, shaping it into the ultimate decentralised chat app.
    Join us in embracing the potential of Web3, where your conversations are secure, your privacy is paramount, and your voice matters. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's co-create the future of messaging together!
  </p>
  
  <h2>Why Web3?</h2>
  
  <p>
    HushBubble empowers users by embracing Web3 principles, putting data ownership back into their hands. 
    Your data is no longer stored on centralised servers controlled by corporations; instead, you get to choose where your conversations are hosted and which app to use:
    <ul>
      <li>Use a cloud server, a friend's server or host your own.</li>
      <li>Use your own company infrastructure, databases and servers.</li>
      <li>Use a third-party app or make your own using open source Web3 libraries.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Privacy and Security Redefined</h2>

  <p>
    With HushBubble, your conversations are end-to-end encrypted and stored securely on a relay server of your choice. 
    Only you and the intended recipients have access to your messages – no third-party or centralised authority can ever intrude on your private conversations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Say goodbye to data breaches, prying eyes, and targeted advertising. 
    Your messages are your own, and your privacy is paramount.
  </p>

  <h2>Development Philosophy</h2>
  
  <p>
    HushBubble is developed in the open, using agile techniques to incorporate user feedback and preferences. 
    We believe in the power of community-driven development, and your opinions matter. 
    By participating in our public chat, you can directly influence the app's future features and enhancements. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Your voice shapes the direction we take, making HushBubble the messaging app you truly want.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Powered by Bubble Protocol</h2>
  
  <p>
    HushBubble leverages Bubble Protocol for its off-chain storage needs.
    Each chat is stored in a bubble on an off-chain storage service of your choice.
    Bubbles act as secure data silos, granting fine-grained access controls through on-chain smart contracts.
    The rules of the bubble - who can access and what they can do - is defined by the smart contract.  
    The difference between a one-to-one chat, group chat or public event chat is down to the smart contract used to construct the bubble.
    This design enables custom chat rules and allows innovative new chat controls, such as permitting only NFT holders to access a chat.
