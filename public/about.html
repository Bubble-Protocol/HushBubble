  <h2>Why Web3?</h2>
  
  <p>
    HushBubble empowers you by embracing Web3 principles: putting data ownership back into your hands; giving you the freedom to choose your preferred app; and reducing costs for your business. 
  </p>
  <h3>Your Data</h3>
  <p>
    Your data is no longer stored on centralised servers controlled by corporations; instead, you get to choose where your conversations are hosted and which app to use:
    <ul>
      <li>Use a cloud server, a friend's server or host your own.</li>
      <li>Use your own company infrastructure, databases and servers.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h3>Your App</h3>
  <p>
    With HushBubble, you get to choose your preferred app.  
    Provided the app is compatible with the open HushBubble protocol then you can chat with any user on any other app.
    <ul>
      <li>Don't like an app interface?  Swap to another or build your own!</li>
      <li>Want to integrate secure chat into your existing application?  Go ahead - it's all open source!</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h3>Your Business</h3>
  <p>
    Since Web3 applications run on open protocols they do not require the complexity of running custom backend servers with their security, maintenance and data protection costs.
    HushBubble is 'just an app' running on the open Bubble Protocol and the blockchain.  This allows it to built and maintained with much lower investment of time and money, cost savings that can be passed on to enterprise customers.
  </p>
  <p>
    A service like Slack, which costs $15/month per active user, for example, can be replaced with a decentralised application and with data hosted on your own servers, or on a cloud bubble service you trust.
  </p>
  <p>
    Furthermore, with HushBubble you are not tied in to any company and can contribute to the open protocol at any time.

  <h2>Privacy and Security Redefined</h2>

  <p>
    With HushBubble, your conversations are end-to-end encrypted and stored securely wherever you choose. 
    Only you and the intended recipients have access to your messages – no third-party or centralised authority can ever intrude on your private conversations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Say goodbye to data breaches, prying eyes, and targeted advertising. 
    Your messages are your own. Your privacy is paramount.
  </p>

  <h2>Development Philosophy</h2>

    HushBubble is developed in the open, using agile techniques to incorporate user feedback and preferences. 
    We believe in the power of community-driven development, and your opinions matter.

  <h2>Powered by Bubble Protocol</h2>
  
  <p>
    HushBubble leverages <a href="https://bubbleprotocol.com">Bubble Protocol</a> for its off-chain storage needs.
    Each chat is stored in a bubble on an off-chain storage service of your choice.
    Bubbles act as secure data silos, granting fine-grained access controls through on-chain smart contracts.
    The rules of the bubble - who can access and what they can do - is defined by the smart contract.  
    The difference between a one-to-one chat, group chat or public event chat is down to the smart contract used to construct the bubble.
    This design enables custom chat rules and allows innovative new chat controls, such as permitting only NFT holders to access a chat.
